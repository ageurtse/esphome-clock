This ia a simple ESPhome project, whicht displays the time on a axs15231  display which could be found on some chinees webshops. 
many thanks for the one who write the display driver.

The font file, should be placed in the esphome/fonts

the code works with esphome dev branche > 11.0

24-11-2024, the code run's fine with the Esphome 11.0 and higher, so no more nede for dev version. 
I also added a bit of code so i can display who is home and who's away.
